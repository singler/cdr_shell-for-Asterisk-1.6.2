This is Asterisk module to execute custom shell script to process CDR records.

Configured script will be executed at the end of each call.

Build this module by copying cdr_shell.c to asterisk_source/cdr/ directory and then running "make".

Install using "make install" or copy asterisk_source/cdr/cdr_shell.so to asterisk's modules directory.

These lines must be added to /etc/asterisk/cdr.conf to configure cdr_shell (changing path parameter as needed):

[cdr_shell]
path=/path/to/some.script
